<h1>Buyly Ecommerce Marketplace</h1>
<p><strong>Buyly</strong> is a fictional e-commerce marketplace inspired by platforms like Mercado Libre, where users can buy, sell, work, and interact with others. The system supports multiple roles including buyer, seller, administrator, and a dedicated superadmin with full platform control.</p>

<p>It features real-time chat for negotiating variable prices or discussing handmade/custom products, and includes multiple payment methods such as credit card, PayPal, and cash. The platform integrates dynamic panels using AJAX for real-time updates, and offers full media handling for both images and videos.</p>

<p>Buyly was developed in just one week using PHP, Composer, MySQL, and SCSS. The interface is modern, responsive, and user-friendly, designed to provide an engaging shopping and management experience.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned & Areas for Improvement</h2>

<p><strong>Real-Time Communication:</strong> While the project includes real-time features using AJAX, implementing <em>Socket.IO</em> would have offered a more scalable and efficient solution for bidirectional communication, especially in the chat system.</p>

<p><strong>API Robustness:</strong> Some of the APIs could be made more consistent and secure by following stricter RESTful standards and adding features like token-based authentication, pagination, and proper error handling.</p>

<p><strong>Payment Integration:</strong> The payment systems (PayPal and cash) work, but could be improved with deeper integration, better validation, and more user feedback in edge cases such as failed transactions or incomplete orders.</p>

<p><strong>Frontend Technology:</strong> Although the interface is functional and modern, migrating to a frontend framework like <em>React</em> would allow better component management, state control, and scalability for future features.</p>


<p><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> The project was developed by a team of two. One team member focused primarily on the UI design and part of the frontend, while I was responsible for the entire backend, parts of the frontend, and the database design and implementation.</p>
